/*Exercise 20: (1) Create an interface with two methods, and a class that implements that
interface and adds another method. In another class, create a generic method with an
argument type that is bounded by the interface, and show that the methods in the interface
are callable inside this generic method. In main( ), pass an instance of the implementing
class to the generic method.*/
